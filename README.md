# DCAMM Equity Framework Proposal

This repository contains the research and analysis for an equity-focused infrastructure investment proposal designed for the Massachusetts Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM). The project uses machine learning to assess and simulate procurement equity, integrating demographic and infrastructure data with predictive modeling.

Developed as part of the ALY 6080 Individual Project at Northeastern University, the framework reflects a commitment to applying data science, ethics, and systems thinking to public sector planning and social equity.

## Project Objective

To build a prototype framework that uses machine learning and open data to support equitable procurement decisions in public infrastructure investments. The model simulates how different regions across Massachusetts might be prioritized using fairness-driven metrics.

## Key Contributions

- Built a supervised machine learning model using **XGBoost** to simulate equitable procurement scenarios.
- Engineered features using **Python (Pandas)** to capture factors like minority population density, poverty levels, and existing infrastructure allocation.
- Used **Seaborn** for exploratory data visualization to assess patterns and biases in historical infrastructure investments.
- Proposed a scalable policy model to guide inclusive and transparent resource allocation at the state level.

## Tools and Packages Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering
- **XGBoost** – predictive modeling
- **Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and documentation environment
- **Excel** – preliminary data review and source compilation, and Initial Visualizations
- **APA 7 Formatting** – for professional report writing and academic documentation

## Methodology Summary

1. **Data Acquisition**: The DCAMM team provided company datasets, including regional demographic indicators and prior infrastructure investments.
2. **Data Preparation**: Combined, cleaned, and transformed data using Pandas and Excel.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized regional disparities and variable distributions using Seaborn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created inputs for the model based on equity dimensions.
5. **Modeling**: Trained and evaluated an **XGBoost classifier** to predict equitable allocation likelihood.
6. **Scenario Simulation**: Used the trained model to simulate how changes in policy inputs could affect resource distribution across communities.

## Deliverables

- XGBoost implementation notebook
- Visual summary of exploratory findings
- Final research brief (PDF) formatted in APA 7 style

## Academic Context

This research was completed as part of the ALY 6080 Signature Project in the Master of Professional Studies in Analytics (Applied Machine Intelligence) program at Northeastern University. It merges the principles of ethical AI, data science, and public interest research to support innovation for social good.
